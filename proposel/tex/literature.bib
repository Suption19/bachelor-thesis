  abstract  = {Problems of data migrations from one data storage to another are always existed, and in era of big data, such problems becoming more crucial. When data started to grow, there is no chance of termination of such process, and in such situation, the important point is not only to just store the data, but also to process on the different levels of granularity. Current work is focused on today's situation of complex data analysis. It mainly concerning data exportation issues and challenges that must be faced by academia and industry in order to solve related problem. Publication sates problematic, provides review of related literature, proposes ideas of solution, that should be implemented, and provides methodology that need to be followed in order to conduct relevant, scientific value adding research.},

  abstract = {It is quite common that most of companies’ decisions are made based on feelings, intuitions or personal experiences. The reasons for such patterns have organizational, technical and process oriented backgrounds. For instance, there is no structured way to deal with the analytical results on both sides simultaneously – organizational and technical. Usually, in case of analytics the ones doing analysis (e.g. data scientists) and the ones using results of analytics (e.g. decision makers) are different persons. As a result, such a structure leads to ambiguity and misunderstanding between the involved parties. In order to bridge the existing gap between data scientists and decision makers, we introduced the Data Product Profile which links both data science and data-driven decision processes.}
